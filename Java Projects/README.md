# Instructions to Setup JavaFX

1. You must have Java installed first.
2. Download the JavaFX SDK for your operating system from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ (the one that says SDK, not mods)
3. The downloaded file should be a .zip file. Extract its contents to a location on your hard-drive. Remember where you put it. A good suggestion to make the later steps easier it to place the JavaFX folder somewhere near the root of your hard drive (e.g., C:\javafx on Windows or /Users/yourname/javafx on Mac). Also, do not include any spaces in the folder names.
4. Go to https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/ and select JavaFX and IntelliJ from the menu. Follow the 5 steps for creating a "Non-modular from IDE" project. Wherever these steps refer to /path/to/javafx-sdk-13, enter the path to the directory where you extracted the files to in the previous step (e.g., C:\javafx on Windows or /Users/yourname/javafx on Mac). Ensure you follow the directions precisely.

# Make sure to:
If all goes well, you should be able to run the Main.java file that was created in the project template and get a blank window. You will have to follow these project setup instructions to create any JavaFX project you need for the course (Assignment #3, a few tutorials). You will also need to perform the "Add VM Options" step for each JavaFX application you want to execute.
If you are having trouble getting JavaFX working, post in Discord or visit office hours. Try to include as much information about the problem that you can (e.g., error messages you get, the precise steps you followed, where you extracted the JavaFX folder to, what values you used for the library and VM options, etc.)
