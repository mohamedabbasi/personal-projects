# Project Based Learning
My first ever computer science class was taught in python, and it is one of the reasons why I enjoy programming. It's easy to learn with a friendly syntax and it is known as a complete production type of language intended for amazing, versatile and top-notch developments and inventiveness. Python also allowed me to research: Machine Learning, Web applications and Software Automated Testing and I'll be showing some of my work in here.
